# Github Integration

## Challenge - Consuming API*

The challenge was to create a web api that consumes the github api returning the given user's repos. As the github api had a limit of 100 repos per request, i implemented the request recursively to load all the repos of the user.

## Challenge - Refresh Token

The challenge was to implement a kind of refresh token, where at any valid request with the user's JWT we created a new JWT and attach it in the response body. All JWT also had a custom ttl (time to live) of one minute.
